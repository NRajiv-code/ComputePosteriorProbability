Task 1:

Command-line Instructions
Prerequisites:
* Install the latest version ofﾃ開ava
* You may need to set yourﾃ開AVA_HOME.
* cd your path~/computer_a_posteriori.java.
* javac computer_a_posteriori.java.
* java computer_a_posteriori.java CLLCCLLLCCL(string you want to enter)
* output can be checked in result.txt file.

Code Structure

* Read the command line arguments using buffer reader to compute the length and take that as input.
* Initialize given prior probabilities in individual arrays.
* Using each individual argument calculate initial probability for Cherry/Lime based on the input if it is C/L.
* Repeat this calculation for each individual argument using a loop.
* Append all buffer data to the initially initialized variables and output data to result.txt.



Task 2:
Command-line Instructions
Prerequisites:
* Install the latest version ofﾃ開ava
* You may need to set yourﾃ開AVA_HOME.
* cd your path~/bnet.java.
* javac bnet.java.
* java bnet Jt given Et Bf(your input for cmd line string).
* Output can be checked in the command palate.

Code Structure:

* Initialize the probabilities for your Bayesian Network as given accordingly.
* Read the input string from cmd line arguments and initialize the variable as required to compute the Bayesian Network.
* Now to compute the probability for P(A/B), compute the numerator and denominator based on the given input if it is Bf,Mt,Jf and iterate through the loop .
* The code has probability computing function that will compute probability for each given condition that would return result at the end.
* Print the result to output.
